# EKS Scalable DevOps Platform

This project provides a scalable DevOps platform deployed on Amazon EKS. The platform includes Kubernetes cluster provisioning with Terraform, CI/CD pipeline setup with Jenkins, and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

**Note: This project is still under active development. The README and documentation may not reflect the most current state of the project.**

## Project Overview

This DevOps platform allows:

1. Automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform
2. Container orchestration with Kubernetes
3. Continuous integration and deployment using Jenkins
4. Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Architecture Overview

A high-level overview of the architecture:

![EKS Scalable DevOps Platform Diagram](assets/eks_scalable_devops_platform_diagram.svg) 

- **Amazon EKS** hosts the Kubernetes cluster
- **Terraform** manages the AWS infrastructure
- **ArgoCD** handles GitOps-style deployments
- **Jenkins** provides CI/CD pipeline capabilities
- **Prometheus & Grafana** enable monitoring and visualization

## Prerequisites

- **Amazon Web Services**** account with billing enabled
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured
- **Terraform** installed on your machine
- **Kubernetes** CLI (kubectl) installed
- **Helm** installed for managing Kubernetes applications
- **Ansible** installed for configuration management
- **minikube** for local development (optional)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Leomendoza13/eks-scalable-devops-platform.git
cd eks-scalable-devops-platform
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS CLI

1. Install AWS CLI if it's not already installed.
2. Authenticate with AWS:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS credentials when prompted.

### Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform

1. Navigate to the development environment directory:

```bash
cd terraform/environnements/dev
```

2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Review the deployment plan:

```bash
terraform plan
```

4. Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

5. Confirm by typing yes when prompted.

The EKS cluster deployment will take approximately 10-15 minutes.

### Step 4: Configure Kubernetes Access

After the EKS cluster is deployed, configure kubectl to connect to it:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-west-3 --name eks-cluster-dev
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

### Step 5: Install ArgoCD

Use Ansible to install ArgoCD:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/env-setup.yml -e environment=dev
ansible-playbook playbooks/install-argocd.yml
```

It will install all we need in the cluster.

### Step 6: Deploy Jenkins and Prometheus

The ArgoCD applications for Jenkins and Prometheus are automatically deployed by ArgoCD.
To check their status:

```bash
kubectl get applications -n argocd
```

### Clean Up

When you're done, you can destroy the infrastructure to avoid unnecessary costs:

```bash
cd terraform/environnements/dev
terraform destroy
```
